                OVERVIEW:<br>
                <br>
            </u>
            I have decided to develop a game using Unity3D this will allow me to use c# for development
            the project name is MicroOps the concept is you have the ability to change your size with machines and the inside entrance to "dungeons" is a
            Modern building concept with randomized levels , you will also be able to mix items together for alchemy in a modern environment,
            as well as find tools for navigation such as rope/hooks with a puzzle/maze level system along with regular size enemies while your shrunk
            your objective is to find and neutralize targets which will also support co op eventually.
